## Week 4 - Banking, PlayerSteering, Flee, Pursure, Offset Pursue, Refactoring


### Lab 
- Work on last weeks lab!

## Week 3 - Physics, Arrive

### Lectures
- [Tuesday class - Physics](https://tudublin-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/bryan_duggan_tudublin_ie/EYLOqYUSkTBAkPOUZUo8j98BSueQVAOsXNrdOUhQPzELrA?e=FiIlJW)
- [Wednesdday class - Arrive Steering behaviour](https://tudublin-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/bryan_duggan_tudublin_ie/Ef8cVWYIlgZDoIXHJaUJoAYB9g_jO18r8Gs1DYr2BCbT-A?e=2bSAuJ)

### Lab

The implementation of BigBoid has been improved to implement "banking" - rotating around the local forward vector: 

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ofb9syLwAQc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofb9syLwAQc)

The technique is discussed in Craig Reynolds papers. We will learn how it works in the class later :-)

Also there are method prototypes for several other behaviours you can try to implement in today's lab:

- Arrive - Slow down as the boid reaches the target
- Pursue - Intercept the target's future position
- PlayerSteering - Take input from the Input system to steer the boid  

Update your forks to get the code! 

## Week 2 - Boids, Seek, Path Following

## Lectures
- [Tuesday  - Path Following](https://tudublin-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/bryan_duggan_tudublin_ie/EcpaiMOskndBoCt1WCmTqXMBKcgs9lgltEaB0tFroced8Q?e=tcDueS) 
- [Wednesday - Physics](https://tudublin-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/bryan_duggan_tudublin_ie/ERq2JlsP7rtCkgCbPcqSI78BRKA8Pno97ZpWm0GzW-3Fvw?e=1kz5RD)

## Lab

### Path following

Update your fork of the repo with the latest code from the master branch of this repo. To do this, cd to the folder where you have your fork cloned and type:

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

This will get the code we wrote last week. Open the Seek scene and you will see a boid that implements seek in the BigBoid.cs class. Today you can implement a path following behaviour for the boid.

Check out this video:

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/eAfpnWI5jEI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAfpnWI5jEI)

The scene contains a game object object with a script called ```Path``` attached. The path script implements the method ```OnDrawGizmos``` to draw lines between the waypoints on the path and to draw a sphere at each of the waypoints. The blue box is following the path. Today you can try and program this behaviour. 

- Implement the ```Path``` script that contains a ```public List<Vector3> waypoints``` containing the waypoints. The 0th waypoint should be the position of the path gameobject itself and the positions of the attached children should be used to set the subsequent waypoints. You can populate this list in ```Awake```. 
- Add a bool flag on the ```Path``` class called ```IsLooped``` to indicate whether the path should loop back to the 0th waypoint when the Boid reaches the last waypoint. If this flag is set to be false, then don't draw a line gizmo back to the 0th waypoint.
- In the scene, create a path using the ```Path``` script you made.
- Add a a public field to the BigBoid class for the Path and drag the Path you made onto this in the Unity editor. 
- Now write code for a behaviour in BigBoid called ```FollowPath``` to get the Boid to move from waypoint to waypoint on the path using Seek and Arrive. If the ```IsLooped``` flag is true on the path, then the Boid should Seek the 0th waypoint again when it reaches the last waypoint. If this flag is set to be false, then the Boid should Arrive at the last waypoint. You will need to add a method called FollowPath and a boolean flag to indicate that the FollowPath behaviour is enabled.
